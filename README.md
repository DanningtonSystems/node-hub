# node-hub

Node Hub is a simple command-line tool for managing SSH connection profiles. It also has some other utility features that are quite swag.

# Installation
***NOTE: THIS PACKAGE IS DESIGNED FOR LINUX ONLY!*** PLEASE CAUTION IF YOU ARE USING ANY OTHER KERNEL/OS, EVEN IF IT'S UNIX-LIKE!

To install node-hub, simply download the latest binary from the Releases page and run it. It isn't designed to be run as root, so you'll need to run it as a normal user. It will auto-create a Documents folder and a node-hub folder if one doesn't already exist.
